    "### What is Corrective RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "Corrective RAG (CRAG) is a methodology that adds a step to the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) strategy to evaluate the documents found during the search process and refine the knowledge. This includes a series of processes to check the search results before generation and, if necessary, perform auxiliary searches to generate high-quality answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieval Grader: Evaluates the relevance of retrieved documents and assigns a score to each document.\n",
    "- Web Search Integration: If quality of retrieved documents is low, CRAG uses web searches to augment retrieval results. It optimizes search results through query rewriting.\n",
