    "# Plan and Execute Pattern using Semantic Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the implementation of the Plan and Execute pattern using Semantic Kernel. This pattern improves agent performance by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Breaking down complex tasks into manageable sub-tasks (Planning)\n",
    "2. Executing each sub-task in sequence\n",
    "3. Adapting to feedback during execution\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Plan and Execute pattern involves:\n",
    "- **Planner**: Responsible for generating a structured plan of sub-tasks\n",
    "- **Executor**: Handles the execution of each sub-task\n",
    "- **Memory**: Maintains context between steps\n",
    "- **Tools**: Custom functions that can be called during execution\n",
    "\n",
    "![Plan and Execute Pattern](../../../1_agentic-design-ptn/images/planning.png)"

    "## Understanding the Plan and Execute Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The Plan and Execute pattern we've demonstrated offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Task Decomposition**: Complex tasks are broken down into simpler, manageable steps\n",
    "2. **Tool Selection**: The planner automatically selects the appropriate tools for each step\n",
    "3. **Adaptability**: If a step fails, the planner can adapt by trying alternative approaches\n",
    "4. **Explainability**: The plan provides transparency into how the agent approaches problems\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is particularly useful for tasks that require multiple steps or the use of various tools to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "The Plan and Execute pattern can be applied to various real-world scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Support**: Helping customers troubleshoot complex issues step by step\n",
    "- **Research Assistance**: Breaking down research questions into specific search queries and synthesis steps\n",
    "- **Task Automation**: Creating workflows that combine multiple API calls and data transformations\n",
    "- **Product Recommendations**: Gathering user preferences and matching them to suitable products\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To extend this pattern, consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Adding error handling to retry failed steps\n",
    "2. Implementing dynamic replanning based on execution results\n",
    "3. Incorporating user feedback between steps\n",
    "4. Adding more specialized tools for specific domains"
