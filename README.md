## Program Ideation Backlog (Temp)
#### 0_basic_rag
#### 1_retrieval (멀티벡터, hyde, parent 같은 pre-retrieval, 리랭크 같은 post-retrieval)
#### 2_tools (기본 tool 사용법, agentic rag같은 기본 개념)
#### 3_domain-specific-rag (RAFT)
#### 4_adaptive_rag (맨 앞단에서 라우팅을 통해 질문에 따라 적응적으로 대응)
#### 5_reflection (중간중간에 계속 evaluation/groundless 체크를 통해 답변 검증)
#### 6_multi-agent-supervisor (감독자 에이전트가 여러 에이전트 관리)
#### 7_multi-agent-collabration (각 페르소나별 에이전트가 역할을 수행..)
#### 8_simulation-and-evaluation (배포 전에 AI봇이 사용자로 빙의해서 테스트하고 자체 평가)
